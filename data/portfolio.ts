    tech: ['Python', 'Z3 Theorem Prover', 'llama.cpp', 'Neo4j', 'networkx', 'matplotlib', 'graphviz', 'JSON', 'SQLite'],
    content: `🧠 Belief Ecology Engine forms a dynamic mental ecosystem where beliefs mutate, compete, and decay naturally.

⚖️ Recursive Contradiction Tracing logs not just failures but the causal chain behind them, enabling long-term correction.

🧬 Contradiction-Formed Identity evolves the system’s personality over time based on which internal battles it wins or loses.

🪞 Meta-Observer Sub-Agent silently monitors identity drift, belief decay, and decision loops — making it self-aware and self-correcting.

🧭 Adaptive Goal Collapse lets it re-prioritize and mutate objectives on its own as belief credibility changes.

🚧 Currently building: Symbolic logic validator, goal forking engine, visual introspection graph, and LLM-simulated inner voice layer.

    tech: ['llama.cpp', 'FAISS', 'Flask', 'Vanilla JS', 'PyTorch', 'Markdown', 'HTML/CSS'],
    content: `💾 Reflexive memory architecture: Daily logs are persistently stored, chunked, vectorized, and semantically retrieved for context-aware planning and regeneration.

🧠 Self-evolving logic: The AI can recall past decisions, codebases, and conversation threads to refine its own modules and regenerate stale logic over time.

📂 File-context-aware prompts: Dynamically injects relevant memory based on active file selection and surrounding intent—eliminating redundant context entry.

🔍 Custom local vector store: Entirely offline memory index (FAISS + JSON) scoped by project, tags, and timestamps, supporting top-K semantic queries with pruning logic.

🧪 Under construction: Summarization engine for long-term memory compaction, live file watchers for auto-context refresh, and intent-based memory routing are being implemented.

🔗 GitHub: Coming soon

🔗 Live preview: Runs locally via Flask dev server — deployment pipeline in development

Notes: Open source plans are queued for post-Week 4 milestone (hybrid online/offline mode)`

    summary: 'A novel cognitive structure where beliefs act like biological entities — evolving, competing, and mutating within an autonomous AI mind.',
    tech: ['Python', 'Neo4j', 'SQLite', 'networkx', 'matplotlib', 'graphviz'],
    content: `🌱 Living Belief Ecosystem — beliefs are treated as organic units with fitness scores, subject to reinforcement, decay, mutation, and death.

🔁 Self-Regulation — the system rebalances its belief pool over time based on internal conflict, relevance decay, and emotional tags.

🧠 Applied in Blackbox Mind v3 — provides the memory substrate and dynamic reasoning context for identity mutation and contradiction-based learning.

🔬 Independent Architecture — designed to function standalone or integrate into any cognitive AI needing long-term autonomous thought evolution.

🧪 Experimental Belief Mutation — merges and morphs related beliefs into higher-order inferences, building a scaffold for emergent self-modification.

🚧 In development: Emotion-weighted reinforcement logic, decay entropy models, and ecological replay prioritization.
